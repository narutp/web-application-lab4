PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. In this lab (homework), I’m trying to use PHP as a backend code for store data into cookies and session.

Comparing cookies and sessions, sessions are stored on server while cookies are stored in the web browser to let user use the data. Sessions are safer than cookies because they store on server not on browser that can catch the data by anonymous user. But sessions are short-term storage, it can only store about half and hour or the data will be deleted. So, sessions are using for store short term information such as variables for calculating, measuring, querying etc. On other hand, cookies are used for long-term information like user’s information so when user shutdown computer, the data will still be on the web browser.

Conclusion, both cookies and sessions can be used widely depends on developer’s opinion or situation to used. Most of the developers are use both of them for their benefit of their application.
